#  Guess Who

Guess Who? is a two-player character guessing game created by Ora and Theo Coster, also known as Theora Design, that was first manufactured by Milton Bradley in 1979 and is now owned by Hasbro.

I thought it might be a fun SwiftUI demo project for the group, I have no intention of publishing the project and would caution anyone who does to make own graphics and and title as game companies like Hasbro are very litigious.

I taken an image from the internet of all the characters, 
added some code to divide the images by name
added some code to capitalize names
created the contentView and populated it with the characters using a navigation link
created a CardView page that shows characters name , image and characteristics
I added a couple of do nothing navigation buttons that would allow for adding a reset option, and another to select a question
questions can be single such as is character wearing a hat or compounded with and or selection

TODO :
Add publisher to present data
Add question sheet 
Add computer opponent (random guessing)
Add multi player option with perhaps firebase or iCloud  as back end


Go through code I wrote and change anything everything, don't be shy I feel free to criticize  I write GEMO style "Good Enough Move On" code
